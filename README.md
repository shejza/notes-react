This is a simple task/time management.

1. User must be able to create an account and log in.
2. User can add (and edit and delete) a row what he has worked on, what date, for how long.
3. Implement two roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
4. Filter entries by date from-to.
